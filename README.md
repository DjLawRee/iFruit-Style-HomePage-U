## Status 

Project is still being developed , I will try to add more functions and / or customization options 

## Inspiration

Once upon a time , I was browsing trough the Chrome extension shop for some nice "Main" or " Home" page , or whatchamacallit , that would use DuckDuckGo as a main search engine.
I found none ( I'm bad at finding things) , so I said SCREW IT , I'll make my own Home-Main-Start or whatchamacallit page , that uses DuckDuckGo!
And here we are.
